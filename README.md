# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-to-control-car
## Four main files
1. 'taking picture' file is to create your own dataset by taking a lot of pictures in each class
2. 'train_own_model_from_vgg16' file is to train your customized model by loading vgg16 from keras and using your own dataset
3. 'tkinter with opencv with keras model' file is to create a user interface embeded with hand gesture recognition using the model you trained before. After you click 'start' button, recognition is started. If you don't want to train model yourself, can run this file straight way using my model.
4. 'arduino_car' file is an arduino file needs to be uploaded to arduino board, which enables bluetooth and motors control.
