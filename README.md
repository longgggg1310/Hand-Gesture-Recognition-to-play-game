# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-to-control-car
## Four main files
1. 'Dataset' document is to make your own dataset by taking a ton of pictures in each class
2. 'train_own_model_from_vgg16' document is to prepare your modified model by keras and utilizing your own dataset
3. 'tkinter with opencv with keras model' file is to create a user interface embeded with hand gesture recognition using the model you trained before. If you don't want to train model yourself, can run this file straight way using my model.
4. 'arduino_car' file is an arduino file needs to be uploaded to arduino board, which enables bluetooth and motors control.
