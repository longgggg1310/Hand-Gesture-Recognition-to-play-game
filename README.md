# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-to-control-car
## Four main files
1. 'Dataset' document is to make your own dataset by taking a ton of pictures in each class
2. 'train_own_model_from_vgg16' document is to prepare your modified model by keras and utilizing your own dataset
3. 'tkinter with opencv with keras model' file is to create a user interface embeded with hand gesture recognition using the model you trained before. If you don't want to train model yourself, can run this file straight way using my model.
